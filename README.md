# Fraud_Transaction_Detection-Project
Any credit card fraud detection system is to identify suspicious events and report them to an analyst while letting normal transactions be automatically processed.
The main aim of the paper is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method for Streaming Transaction Data, with an objective, to analyse the past transaction details of the customers and extract the behavioural patterns. Where cardholders are clustered into different groups based on their transaction amount.
